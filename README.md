# Datasets:
Three PolSAR datasets were utilized to assess the performance of the CV-MsAtViT method in this study. Flevoland, San Francisco, and Oberpfaffenhofen.
link to the datasets along their class maps is available at:

# Requirement
Python 3.9.18, Tensorflow (and Keras) 2.10.0, cvnn 2.0, Tensorflow Probability 0.18.0

# Results
To quantitatively measure the proposed CV-MsAtViT model, three evaluation metrics are employed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, Overall Accuracy (OA), Average Accuracy (AA) and Cohen's Kappa (k). Also, Each class accuracy has been reported.
